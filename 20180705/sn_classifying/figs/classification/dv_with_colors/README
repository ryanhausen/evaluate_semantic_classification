devocaluer as a function of s/n


The following files are RGBA representations of the morphological profiles:

- 1-color-classification.pdf
- 2-color-classification.pdf
- 3-color-classification.pdf
- 4-color-classification.pdf

Each morphology was assigned a color, as indicated in the legend:
Spheroid:     Red
Disk:         Blue
Irregular:    Green
Point Source: Yellow

The '#-color' desgination how many of the classes were used to generate the
'RGB' portion of the pixel value, the 'A' portion is equal to 1-background.
For example in the 2-color-classificaiton.pdf the top 2 mean classification
values were used. 

The 4-color separates each class into its own pixel. So the resulting
image is twice as big as the input image. It tranlates as follows:

output_pixel[i,j] = spheroid_mean[i,j] (red)
output_pixel[i+1,j] = disk_mean[i,j] (blue)
output_pixel[i, j+1] = irregular_mean[i,j] (green)
output_pixel[i+1, j+1] = point_source_mean[i,j] (yellow)

The res of the files I believe you have seen before.

I used https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.dblquad.html
to integrate the sersic function over x and y for each pixel and used those
values for the image, which is in log scaling

Then the graph is the surface brightness profile with log scaling in blue
and the ration of total light in for the source in red in with linear scaling

validate_dv.png is for a sersic n=4
validate_exponential.png is for a sersic n=1

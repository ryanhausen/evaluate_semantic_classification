I have updated the source generation routine to calculate the integral
of the sersic profile over x and y using https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.dblquad.html

I also included the tiny tim convolution and I think the results look better

So now the pipeline to generate a source looks like this:

1. generate the source using the integral over the pixel area, for each pixel
2. adjust the image values to have the proper s/n ratio
3. convolve with tinytim for the approprate band
4. add to noise

I have played with the ordering some and this seems to have the best results

In this directory:

/dv_with_colors
- shows results for updated De Vaucouleurs over varying s/n

/exp_with_colors
- shows results for updated exponential over varying s/n

/validate_sbp
- a sanity check on the values generated using the integral

/varying_n_with_colors
- shows results for varying sersic index over constanst s/n of 10

================================================================================
The current morhpological accuracy is:

Top 1:  0.59457111835
The class with the highest probability is the same.

Average Top 2:  0.737242128122
The top two classes are the same, irrespective of order

Average In Top 2:  0.836699239957
Our top 1 class is one of the top 2 classes in the label

In this directory:

/classifications 
- contains the outputs from the classifier for the HJ image

/input
- contains the H and J band images given to the classifier

/jeyhan_imgs
- contains the H band postage stamps from Jeyhan

/output
- contains a directory for each image from jeyhan that is also in the image 
  we classified. In each directory there is the H band image from jeyhan,
  a 4x84x84 matrix containing the mean values for each class, a 4x84x84 matrix
  containing the variance values for each class, the segmap that was generated
  with the id given to the source stored in the name. For example, if a segmap
  is called segmap-3.fits then the part of the segmap that belongs to the source
  we care about is 3 in the segmap.
